title: FTP
---

FTP is a good initialism, its many meanings have meant a lot to me
over the years:

* File Transfer Protocol - 1971 to present. I really enjoy file hosting.
* Fight the Power - Anyone who knows me can attest to my history.
* Free the Palestinians - Palestine is still the issue
* Fuck the Police - They've been terrible to me and most everyone I know who has interacted with them
* Failure to Profit - Productivity and profitability do not always intersect

But also:

* Feed the Pigeons (tuppence tuppence)
* Feel the Pain/Passion/Pressure/Pulse/Pinch
* Fermat's Theorem Proof
* Fifty Two Pickup
* Find the Pickle
* Fit to Print
* Foiled Twisted Pair
* For the present
* "For two pins"
* Foster the People (unfortunately)
