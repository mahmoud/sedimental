Most blogs, like this one, are reverse-chronological,
causing the first post to appear last in the archive. This convention
makes a [colophon][colophon] the [King's Pawn Game][kingspawn] of web
authorship; there's no better place to showcase certain implementation
details than the first post of a blog.

This site is generated with [Chert][chert_github][^pronounce], an
open-source static site generator built with [Python][python],
[Markdown][markdown][^emd], [ashes][ashes], [pygments][pygments], and
[YAML][yaml]. Chert is named for a very common [fine-grained
sedimentary rock][chert_rock], often referred to as _flint_, which has
been of critical use to firestarters through the ages.

_(Keep an eye out for a forthcoming, longer entry on why I built Chert
and what makes it different.)_

[^pronounce]:
    English pronunciation rhymes with _dirt_,
    maintainer/Farsi pronunciation: _chair_ with a _t_ at the end.

[^emd]:
    Enhanced Markdown, including support for
    [footnotes][footnotes], [definition lists][deflists], and [tables of
    contents][tocs].
