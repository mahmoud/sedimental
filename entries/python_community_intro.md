The [PSF](https://www.python.org/psf/ "Python Software Foundation")
just created a new mailing list, ["PSF-Community"][psf_community],
then autosubscribed a bunch of people and solicited introductions. At
first I was surprised, but I was quickly charmed by
[the response][list_archive] and joined in on the action. Here's what
I [wrote][archive]:

> If Alex Martelli [is doing it][alex_email], then brace yourselves
> because the floodgates are open.
>
> I first used Python as a junior in a South Dakota high school, off a
> Knoppix CD because "[Live CDs][live_cds]" were all the rage then. It
> was a good fad because I didn’t have a computer, and the Windows
> machines at school weren’t writable and didn’t have Python (2.2 at the
> time). I read a bit of the tutorial and wrote a really bad
> [prime number sieve][primes].
>
> After a professional loop through Java, C++, C#, and finally PHP, I
> resumed Python development in 2009 as a full-stack web developer at
> PayPal. I wrote the tool that (still) manages all the pricing
> arrangements.
>
> From there I hired my first teammate and we wrote a couple other
> business-critical components before standardizing out PayPal’s first
> grassroots alternative stack. That was early 2011 and since then we’ve
> had [a lot of fun][myths] and [come so far][support]. Now we’re
> focusing on PayPal’s security offerings: putting Python at the very
> heart of PayPal’s availability model, handling _billions_ of requests
> per day. And believe me when I say that’s it’s the best thing that’s
> happened to PayPal’s security in a long time! The details will have to
> wait for a future blog post (and upcoming O’Reilly project). Or, if
> you’re remotely as excited as I am, you can email me directly. :)
>
> On the side, I really enjoy working on
> [Wikipedia][l2w]-[based][weeklypedia] [projects][rcmap] > [under][seealso] [the banner of][hatnotable] [Hatnote][hatnote], all
> Python. Most recently, we did
> [the official Wikipedia IFTTT channel][ifttt_guide] (handling 1.3
> million requests per day). And because I can’t get enough, a bunch of
> [open-source stuff][github], most notably [Boltons][boltons], where
> I’ve been particularly busy lately.
>
> If you’re in the Bay Area, do _not_ hesitate to reach out to talk about
> Python, Wikipedia, security, federated and open systems (like BBS
> stuff), or even PayPal!
>
> Specifically, this is sort of odd, but October 14th at 1pm, I'm doing
> an overview of Python usage at PayPal, and would like to invite anyone
> senior and curious to be my guest and come to PayPal in San Jose to
> check it out. Guido came in 2012 and [he loved it][python_day]. And
> stuff now is waaaay cooler!
>
> Anyways, I just wanted to end by saying thanks to you all. If you
> hadn't been so numerous and out there, I probably would have gotten
> myself fired long before any of this bore fruit. ;)
>
> THANKS!

> Mahmoud

There were a lot of autosubscribed folks deploring the spammish
inquisition and threatening unsubscription, so here's hoping my straw
didn't break too many camels backs.
