title: Awesome Python Applications
---

<!--

Every day, you and I write code that someone else could probably
use. Nothing quite matches that feeling of efficiency and
elegance. Code reuse is truly is a marvel of software. So much so,
that we scarcely think twice before writing code to be reused...

OR

Programming languages are great, but wow, there are quite a few. One
of the best measures of success for an established technology is to
survey successful applications. As it so happens, Python is quite the
successful technology!

OR

Here in the software world, we focus a lot on code reuse and
abstraction. So much so that our most famous celebrities are language
creators and library maintainers. But while there's no better feeling
than finding that library or language that saves you hours, months,
and weeks, that's a special experience only a developer can enjoy. To
prove its value to society, software finds another way: *the
application*.

If you're reading this, you probably read and write code. Somehere in
the excitement of software's abstraction, we can lose sight of where
the rubber meets the road. Where our reusable modules and packages and
frameworks turn into real-world applications.

That's why I'm pleased to announce *Awesome Python Applications*, a
hand-curated list of 180+ projects, all of which are:

1. Free software with an online source repository.
2. Using Python for a considerable part of their functionality.
3. Well-known, or at least prominently used in an identifiable niche.
4. Maintained or otherwise demonstrably still functional on relevant platforms.
5. Applications, not libraries or frameworks.

Exceptions can be made within reason.

This list predominantly focuses on software that installs without
`pip` or PyPI, and whose audience is mostly *not* developers. There's
still plenty of that in there, too, but the view taken is broader.

So why do we need a catalog of open-source Python applications?

# Goal #1: A New Development Flow

Ever since I started
[talking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLVNWfPWAC8)
[about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfI2hdK6vVY) [Python
packaging](http://sedimental.org/the_packaging_gradient.html), people
have been asking me questions about which packaging technique is best
for their software. I was struck, over and over again, how far people
can get in developing an application before reaching the fundamental
question of delivery. Exploring this, I landed on a more basic
question:

> Why are so many people building applications from first
> principles (blog posts and Stack Overflow)?

Isn't Python one of the largest programming languages in the world?
Aren't there dozens of successful, real-world applications written in
Python? What are the chances your application is totally unique?

So "Awesome Python Applications" is really an attempt to create a
new flow for answering tough development questions. When seeking to
build an application or solve a dev problem, scan the list for
projects which most closely match your project's requirements. Then,
see what architecture worked for them.

A production application worth a thousand blog posts.

Back in school, I learned more about architecture and software
development from the MediaWiki source code than I did from any one
class. APA is the next step in enabling the holistic education of a
working application with real users.

# Goal #2: Complete the Python Production Loop

Python developers are also software users. Unlike other software
users, we know how to file issues and may even make significant
contributions back to the application we use. By preferring Python
software, we take one step closer to pitching in. Not to mention,
Python developers interested in developing their own
application-development skills will find this experience much more
edifying than lower-level library work.

# Goal #3: Anchor the Python Ecosystem

Finally, it is my sincere hope to help anchor the Python community in
its real-world applications. With the pace and cerebrality of
technology, it can be easy to get ahead of ourselves and our
users. These projects represent the best of the free and living
portion of Python up until this point. Not only is it something to use
and be proud of, but it's something to support, in spirit and in practice.

A keen eye will notice how [the list is
structured](https://github.com/mahmoud/awesome-python-applications/blob/master/projects.yaml). This
isn't just for consistent rendering, but because I hope we will
explore the ecosystem with the relationship between libraries and
applications in mind. Metrics aren't everything, but it would be very
interesting to see the Python FOSS ecosystem modeled in the scientific
publishing framework. Can we get interesting metrics by treating
libraries as "articles" and applications as "journals"? Application
userbase approximations can give us much deeper insight into
real-world impact than opaque package download counts.

# In short

This essay may appear shorter than some of my others, but it's because
you have a lot of reading ahead of you. The list is here...

<!-- All that designing, emailing, reading, documenting, coding, debugging,
presenting, and publishing that we pour into open-source and
reusability? That manifests here. -->

# Motivation / Goals

The foremost goal of APA is to survey the wide range of Python's
applicability, studying the architectures, dependencies, and design
patterns that have worked in shipping and maintaining projects. By
compiling and categorizing a reference of architectures, we can answer
a lot of questions and settle a lot of debates, especially for
greenfield projects. Without a doubt, these are the patterns that have
worked at the scale that matters to most new projects.
