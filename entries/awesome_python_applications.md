title: Awesome Python Applications
---

Every day, you and I write code that someone else could probably
use. Nothing quite matches that feeling of efficiency and
elegance. Code reuse is truly is a marvel of software. So much so,
that we scarcely think twice before writing code to be reused...

OR

Programming languages are great, but wow, there are quite a few. One
of the best measures of success for an established technology is to
survey successful applications. As it so happens, Python is quite the
successful technology!

OR

Here in the software world, we focus a lot on code reuse and
abstraction. So much so that our most famous celebrities are language
creators and library maintainers. But while there's no better feeling
than finding that library or language that saves you hours, months,
and weeks, that's a special experience only a developer can enjoy. To
prove its value to society, software finds another way: *the
application*.

# Criteria

List members should be:

* Using Python for a considerable part of their functionality.
* Well-known, or at least prominently used in an identifiable niche.
* Maintained or otherwise demonstrably still functional on relevant platforms.
* Available as source code, with a publicly-accessible source control repository.

Exceptions can be made within reason.

# Motivation / Goals

The foremost goal of APA is to survey the wide range of Python's
applicability, studying the architectures, dependencies, and design
patterns that have worked in shipping and maintaining projects.

A bonus goal is to close the Python production loop. Python developers
know how to file issues and may even make significant contributions
back to the application they use. And Python developers interested in
developing their own application-development skills will find this
development experience much more edifying than lower-level library
work.

Finally, it is my sincere hope that the list helps anchor the Python
community. With the pace of things, it can be easy to get ahead of
ourselves. These projects represent the free and living portion of the
sum of all Python up until this point. All that designing, emailing,
reading, documenting, coding, debugging, presenting, and publishing
that we pour into open-source and reusability? That manifests here. We
must do what we can to support and grow this list.
