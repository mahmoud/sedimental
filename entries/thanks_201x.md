title: "Thanks, 201X!"
---
* Been a long decade, but it's flown past. Thought I'd take a moment
  to reflect on as much as can be reflected on in a Sunday afternoon.
* Ten years of full-time professional software engineering.
  * I can't possibly summarize it all, but I can point to the
    artifacts I tried to leave along the way:
    * Open-Source Projects (2012+)
    * Hatnote Projects (2013+)
      * Hatnote Blog / Twitter
      * See, Also
    * This Blog (2015+)
    * Talks (2016+)
    * Pyninsula (2017+) - [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/Pyninsula), [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Pyninsula-Python-Peninsula-Meetup/), [Website](https://pyninsula.org/), [Email Announce](https://mail.python.org/mailman3/lists/pyninsula-announce.python.org/)
  * I've had a Twitter since 2008, but I mostly use it to cross-post
    blog posts or help friends promote their projects. The process of
    tweeting feels so perfunctory, and the service itself so tenuous,
    that I can't bring myself to invest the time. But until I start an
    email newsletter, it's how you can find out where I'm speaking.
* And what do I have to show for it?
  * Each project and post is its own reward, but even those don't tell
    the whole story.
  * Most recently the PSF made me a Fellow. Instead of being all cool
    and nonchalant about it, I can't really understate the meaning of
    this, working in a field like software, where concrete symbols of
    progress are alternatingly elusive and vanishing. I have to thank
    the PSF for dedicating the time to ramping up these awards. They've
    convinced me more than ever that we need more institutions to build
    this sort of advancement.
  * Got to dip into startups for the last few years and it wasn't a
    total bust. Even bought a place in my favorite neighborhood to
    prove it. Managed to stay away from industry hype, on the
    principle that massive speculative capital influx isn't where real
    value is added to society, and doesn't generate the kind of
    innovation I care about.
  * I've seen too many engineers sucked in by new technologies and
    ventures, only to find themselves alienated from their work. Even
    if it's not center stage anymore, the burnout conversation
    smolders on, because it's a very real issue. Some problems can be
    solved by paying the maintainers, but I think the vastly bigger
    issue is about losing the human connection between the real effort
    software takes and the real benefits it can bring. That's why I'm
    incredibly thankful for the Wikimedian community for always being
    there, patient with schedules and issues, as long as the software
    got the job done. It can be a challenge to juggle, but I tell
    every budding engineer: find a direct connection to people who will
    appreciate your work.
  * Married my wonderful wife Maya. We met at a conference, so here's
    your daily reminder to get out into the world.
  * I always forget something, but it's not like I could list
    everything here anyways.
* The Bad
  * Lots of stuff has gone well for me, plenty to be thankful for
  * Increasing cynicism
  * Loss of optimism around software's ability to impact things for
    the better (totally understandable)
* Next up
  * We're going to motherland for a bit, that usually gives me
    pause. But at this point, I'm probably not going to 180. If I wrap
    2029 on the same trajectory, having come as far as I did this
    decade, I don't see how I could be disappointed with that.
