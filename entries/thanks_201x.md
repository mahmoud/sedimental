*Thought I'd take a Sunday afternoon to reflect on, oh I don't know, a decade.*

<img align="right" width="40%" src="/uploads/illo/legatree_med.png">
Been a long ten years, but it's flown past. This particular decade
happens to coincide with my first years of full-time professional
software engineering.

# The Quantity

I can't possibly summarize it all, and if I tried, it'd still be
colored by what's on my mind right now. But I can point to the
artifacts I tried to leave along the way:

* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mhashemi) FWIW[^1] (2008+)
* **~20** [Open-Source Projects](/projects.html) (2012+)
* **~15** [Hatnote Projects](/hatnote_projects.html) (2013+, [follow us](https://twitter.com/hatnotable))
* **~25** entries on this blog (2015+)
    * **+7** [here](https://medium.com/paypal-engineering/tagged/python) (2014-2016)
    * Not including [pythondoeswhat.com](https://www.pythondoeswhat.com/) or [blog.hatnote.com](https://blog.hatnote.com/)
    * (or other posts on the blogs only real heads know)
* **~10** [Talks](/talks.html) (2016+)
    * Lest I forget: [O'Reilly's Enterprist Software with Python](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920047346.do?code=authd) (2016)
    * And [several podcast/media appearances](/appearances.html)
* [calver.org](https://calver.org/) (2016) and [0ver.org](https://0ver.org/) (2018) (Versioning is a fun pastime)
* [Pyninsula](https://pyninsula.org/) (2017+) - [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/Pyninsula), [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Pyninsula-Python-Peninsula-Meetup/), [Email Announce](https://mail.python.org/mailman3/lists/pyninsula-announce.python.org/)

Taking a chronological look at each of the above, I'm relieved to see
obvious growth.

If I were to highlight one resource, it would probably be the
[talks](/talks.html). Despite the stress of preparation and delivery, I'm least
concerned with having a massive miscommunication when we're all in the
room and I can see the points hitting home. It's impossible to pick a
favorite, but [Ask the
Ecosystem](/talks.html#ask-the-ecosystem-lessons-from-350-foss-python-applications)
(2019), the [Restructuring
Data](/talks.html#restructuring-data-in-python) lightning talk (2018),
and [The Packaging
Gradient](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLVNWfPWAC8) (2017) seem
like audience faves from where I'm sitting.

# The Quality

Each project, post, and talk had its own reward, but I guess I've got
more than just those to show for the decade.

On the more profit-driven side, I built tools and teams at PayPal, but
once I could manage the risk, I got to dip into startups for the last
few years. Lucky for me, it wasn't a total bust, and the wife and I
bought a place in [my favorite neighborhood (in the
USA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japantown,_San_Jose). Not a
millionaire, but I'm hoping and working for a world where no one has
to be.

More recently, the Python Software Foundation [made me a
Fellow](http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2019/11/python-software-foundation-fellow.html). This
isn't something I can be nonchalant about, and I'm not going to
understate how much this means, to me, working in a field like
software, where concrete symbols of progress are alternatingly elusive
and vanishing. Plus it's Python, and reciprocated love is nice. I have
hundreds of people to thank for helping me reach this point, and I
have to thank the PSF for dedicating the time to ramping up these
awards. They've convinced me more than ever that we need more
institutions to build this sort of advancement.

To all of you, thank you.

# The Struggle

I like to think I managed to do all of the above while staying away
from industry hype, on the principle that massive speculative capital
influx isn't where real value is added to society, and doesn't
generate the kind of innovation that excites me.

I may have been na√Øve, but I came to Silicon Valley with an idea
about the transformative power of software. Changing times may
illustrate a grittier interpretation than the one I had and have, but
I continue to hold dear software's potential for positive impact. If
you've felt that vision waver, let me tell you, you're not alone.

In the past decade, I've seen too many engineers sucked in by new
technologies and ventures, only to find themselves alienated from
their work. Episodes ranging from an afternoon lost to debugging
Docker/k8s clusters, to years of work disappearing at the end of a VC
runway. Nothing has been harder to watch than those
bedraggled-but-persistent idealists regroup, each time a bit more
cynical than the last.

Even if its seeming intractibility has taken it from the center stage,
the burnout conversation continues to smolder, because there's no
issue realer. I know; I released more ceramics than software [back in
2014](https://www.flickr.com/photos/mahmoudhashemi/albums/72157648555341327).

Some problems can be solved by [paying the
maintainers](https://opensource.com/article/18/9/its-time-pay-maintainers),
but I think the vastly bigger issue is around losing the human
connection between the real effort software takes and the real
benefits it brings, combined with FOSS's dearth of collaborators in
supporting roles (QA, product/project/release management).

That's why I'm incredibly thankful for the Wikimedia community for
always being there, patient with schedules and issues, as long as the
software got the job done. It can be a challenge to juggle projects,
but I tell every budding engineer: find that direct connection to
people who will appreciate your work, and avoid cynicism at all costs.

There are some interesting prospects in the works, but I'm keeping
this post retro. Besides, if 2029 rolls around and all I did was break
even with 2009-19, I don't see how I can be disappointed.

Thanks again for everything in 201X, and for sticking with me in 202X.

[^1]: Despite using [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mhashemi) for over a
      decade, the process of tweeting feels so perfunctory, and the
      service itself so tenuous, that I still can't bring myself to
      invest the time. I mostly use it to crosspost my blog posts or
      help friends promote their posts/projects.

      But until I start an email newsletter, or really get on top of
      [yak.party](https://yak.party), it's still the best I got for
      announcing where I'm speaking next.
