Bad things happen when we don't repeat the obvious.

It's 9pm and I'm writing a post for [the company engineering
blog][pp_eng_blog]. Every sentence is a slog. Not because I'm exacting and
conciseness isn't my strong suit. My writing is slow because every
word is obvious, almost patronizing.

Obvious realities bear repetition, and so must you. Common sense is
not so common. The majority of ideas floating around try too
hard. They're designed to confuse, seduce, and sell. Press releases
and ads push to the forefront, while reviewed articles and texts sit
on shelves and in queues.

Repeat the obvious, so we stay on the same page. [The ways][hard_way]
we [rush people][obama_code] into technology leaves
[little time][code_8weeks] for foundations. Software is so new and
developers so in-demand, every wave brings more fresh minds than the
last. Developers are arriving faster than knowledge can diffuse.

Repeat the obvious, to keep perspective. Technology may favor the new,
but fundamentals do exist. Without reminders, time buries working
technologies in the dust of silence.

Repeat the obvious, to avoid bizarre dark ages. Take functional
programming's disappearance in the 1990s/2000s, cast aside in favor of
object orientated hype. Or that one time when not enough programmers
talked about and taught [event-driven servers][event_loop] programming
and [Frankenstein][node] was cast as revolutionary.

So I hope you'll forgive the repetition. It hurts me more than it
hurts you, and believe me when I say it helps many. Documentation does
not equal disussion. The modern media landscape demands a technology
have both docs and discourse to remain useful.

Until we live in a world where reference rules over repetition, you
can help by writing about something painfully obvious to you. Bad
things happen when we don't repeat the obvious.
