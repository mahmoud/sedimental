I wake up with a jolt, spilling most of my breakfast cereal onto a
thirsty couch. My eyes find the clock. Cleaning will have to wait. I'm
downing water like there's no tomorrow, but really tomorrow starts in
one minute. Still drinking. All work is thirsty work if the day is
long enough, and engineering is no exception. Time's up.

From the literal break of dawn to sunset, no food, drink, or other
respite. It's [Ramadan][ramadan]. What does this mean, practically?
Well, summertime here in Silicon Valley, it means from 4am to 9pm, I
battle human nature while writing emails and software. But, far from
an antiquated ritual, I see Ramadan as an exercise in lifestyle
design.

As we near the end of Ramadan [1436][islamic_calendar], this year has
proven that even in modern and diverse environs, every year brings the
same reactions and questions as 1435. Mostly boiling down to:

- ["What? Not even water?"](#what-not-even-water)
- ["Why?"](#why)
- ["How?"](#how)

# What? Not even water?

A bit facetious, but this really is the most common question I get. So
just to be clear, traditional interpretation calls for no food, drink
(including water), or drugs. From the crack of dawn to sunset. Or
[in the technical terms][wunderground], the beginning of sunrise's
[astronomical twilight][astro_twilight] to the beginning of sunset's
[civil twilight][civil_twilight].

Individuals adjust according to limitations. If you're not healthy
enough to fast, you don't fast. If you feel like you can't complete a
fast, you don't. If the [sun doesn't set][arctic_fast], just do
something reasonable. Your intentions are your own, and self-harm does
not enter into the purposes of Ramadan.

# Why?

Everyone has their reasons, but first off Ramadan is not some sort of
collective diet. Yes, Ramadan is used by many as a springboard to
stymie smoking, overeating, and other unhealthy physical habits. But
for me, fasting is about building four virtues:

- Empathy
- Reflection
- Discipline
- Confidence

Not exactly the stuff of classrooms and annual compliance
trainings. And yet people are expected to just find these
characteristics within themselves, even in environments most
antithetical. Countless well-compensated designers and engineers know
about the limits of limitless life. We almost immediately
[pine][constraints_1] [for][constraints_2]
[constraints][constraints_3]. [Negative liberty][neg_lib] only goes so
far, then real freedom becomes about the ability to formulate and
follow the orders you give yourself. Design grants creative autonomy,
but design tools offer a hundred possibilities draped in a thousand
distractions.

Empathy is the most obvious trait built by fasting, and the one
promoted most when I was younger. There are poor people in the world,
and all should experience their hunger and thirst to
understand. Fasting puts you on the path closest to the one they walk,
building a visceral empathy that simple imagination can't match. When
was the last time you were [hungry like the wolf][like_the_wolf]? One
month of senses too sharp for civil society. One month of feeling the
natural appetites object and interrupt your every thought. But it
keeps one connected to so many people, from the most
[intense protesters][hunger_strikes] to as many as
[a fifth of][student_hunger_1] [American students][student_hunger_2].

Reflection is critical to the Ramadan fast. Take away food and water,
and within a few hours you're transported to the banks of a personal
[Walden Pond][walden]. In much the same way that exercise burns off dirty,
anxious energy, fasting stops it from being produced in the first
place. It quiets the shores of one's psyche and in the stillness, all
is clear. This is the part of Ramadan I look forward to most: a
staycation from my usual self-imposed obligations. The line between
essential and unnecessary is bright. I don't know much about
meditation, but most days of the month, around sunset, I find a
certain peaceful state, every thought sorted away in its right place.

Midday is another story. Shouldering a normal workload with the added
constraint of a fast is the definition of a stress test. Except unlike
software and other commonly-tested constructs, the systems at work
here involved grow and strengthen naturally. During Ramadan, I
stockpile this discipline to burn over the next 11 months. Discipline
complements motivation, especially with creative work like software
and architecture. Whereas frustration obviates motivation, [discipline
rises to the occasion][discipline], grateful for the opportunity to push through
and grow.

All of the above pours into the last attribute. Confidence is deeply
linked to feelings of sufficiency: the ability to say, "What I have is
enough to do what I want to do." I'm a big fan of water myself, but
even something as essential as hydration isn't as [big][trago]
[a deal][hidrate] [as we make it][vessyl]. My adolescent fascination
with basketball was rooted in
[Hakeem Olajuwon playing whole NBA games][hakeem] against the Chicago
Bulls, 12 hours into a fast. More recently,
[a fasting Algeria played a strong World Cup game][algeria] against
winners-to-be Germany. People thirst for confidence, not
water. Ramadan is a reminder that personal excess breeds
anxiety. Consumerism's advertising immerses us in false
dependence. Ramadan is the gentle reaffirmation you send yourself
that, yes, _you_ can do more with less.

# How?

At this point, the _how_ is more of a logistical appendix, but this
year's approach was particularly successful. Each year, Ramadan's
approach gets me nervous. No matter how many times I fast, despite
having survived and thrived not one year ago, I still get skittish at
the thought of it. I focus in on the circumstances new to the year,
and can't help tweaking my design.

Everyone has different lives and schedules, but my Ramadan unfolds in
three phases:

- Phase 1: Just make it through in one piece. The first 4-5 days.
- Phase 2: Requires a conscious and concerted effort. The middle twenty days or so.
- Phase 3: The fast is the new normal. Usually just the last few days of the month.

My Ramadan technique goes into effect from day 1. It can be a rough
transition, involving some falling asleep while eating cereal, but the
long-day summer technique has been perfected over years. Granted, its
design leans on the unique schedule afforded a young software
engineer. Not everyone can switch away from a standard
work-a-day-sleep-at-night schedule. The median practicing Western
Muslim probably approaches Ramadan like this:

- Get to work at 9am.
- Work til 5pm.
- Get home at 6pm. Cook, clean, tend to kids.
- Eat at 9pm.
- Sleep around midnight.
- Wake up before 4am, eat again.
- Sleep until 6-8am.

Straightforward enough, but far from optimal. There's no period
of sleep longer than 4 hours, which leaves my energy on a different
valence altogether. For the last three years, I've improved on the
na√Øve solution, by switching to a [bimodal sleep schedule][bimodal_sleep]:

- Get to work around 11am.
- Skip lunch, hit the books til 5-6pm.
- Get home, take a long nap at 7pm. This last bit would just be
  clockwatching anyways.
- Wake up at 9pm. Dinner for breakfast!
- Read, write, and code for the next 6 hours.
- 3:45am. Eat breakfast, taking care not to fall asleep.
- Sleep through til 10am and repeat.

It's a fun change of pace. If the workday seems short, keep in mind
that there are no meal or snack breaks, so it evens out. Similarly,
there's a lot of new time discovered in these quiet, contemplative
nights. Overall my energy, while restricted, stays predictable and
manageable. I'm no Hakeem Olajuwon or Algerian footballist, but this
year I managed to continue to bike everywhere, several times riding 6
to 15 miles per day. Other innovations this year have included playing
violin to stay awake and just eating a small bowl of raisin bran for
breakfast. Eating less is unintuitive, but I wake up less thirsty than
trying to cram in more calories, and hunger is easier to manage than
thirst. Oh, and

<!-- After a 17-hour day, your body greets food and water like parched
earth does rain. Unfamiliar, no matter how much water you drink, it
takes at least an hour before you begin to feel hydrated again. -->

Sometimes during the day I'd find myself impatient, checking the
calendar to see how many days are left. But just as many times at
night I've caught myself lamenting the quickness with which my split
days have slid past. With [Eid-ul-Fitr][eid] right around the
corner, I must admit I am pleased with the special satisfaction
brought by another year, another fast well designed.
