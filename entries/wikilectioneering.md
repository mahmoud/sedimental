title: Wikilectioneering
---

Over the last several months, I've been busy busy helping with Wiki
Loves Monuments, and specifically building Montage, the new judging
platform for Wiki Loves Monuments 2016. The process was full of
surprises, and one of the most pleasant surprises was the opportunity
to research voting systems.

At the time, it seemed niche, but as November came and went, interest
in voting systems shot up and stayed up.

Most literature you'll find about voting centers on large-scale
political arenas. While Wiki Loves Monuments is large in the scale of
its submissions, the contest jurors, our voting population, almost
always number in the single digits. And unlike a presidential
election, all contests have more than one winner. How many public
office elections do you know where the winners can outnumber the
voters?

So choosing our approach became a matter of design.
