Over the last several months, I've been busy-busy helping with
[Hatnote][hatnote] work, and specifically building
[Montage][montage_process], the new judging platform for
[Wiki Loves Monuments][wlm] 2016. The process was full of surprises,
and one of the most pleasant of which was the opportunity to research
voting systems.

At the time, the topic of voting systems seemed niche, but as November
came and went, interest shot up and stayed up.

Most literature you'll find about voting centers on large-scale
political arenas. While Wiki Loves Monuments is large in the scale of
its submissions, the opposite is true for contest jurors, our voting
population, who number between 3 and 30. And unlike a presidential
election, all contests have multiple winners. How many public
office elections do you know where the winners can outnumber the
voters?

So choosing our approach became a matter of design.
