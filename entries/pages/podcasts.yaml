There are a lot of great audio periodicals out there, and as with
everything mobile, the pathways for discovery are limited.

Rather than just qualitative scores, the ratings used here have
specific meanings:

>  **5** - I listen to every episode and regularly recommend it to others.<br/>
>  **4** - I listen to every episode.<br/>
>  **3** - I listen to episodes, but don't sweat missed ones.<br/>
>  **2** - I listen to select episodes, based on title and description.<br/>
>  **1** - I started listening and I stopped.<br/>

I'm drawn to history and science podcasts more than entertainment,
news, and commentary.

title: Hardcore History
rating: 5
ep_length: 2+ hours
ep_count: 55+

review: >-

  My first foray into internet broadcasting, I listened to Hardcore
  History for years before finishing it and being forced to search for
  similarly green pastures.

  I'm no historian. I don't memorize dates and place names. I look to
  take two practical things from history literature: identifiable
  themes and common metaphor.

  Themes are the gateway to human nature as it has transpired in the
  past. How have different people and cultures handled power and
  decline and everything in between? The present has far more in
  common with the past than school-taught history led me to believe,
  and I have Dan Carlin's careful arrangements for making me certain
  of this.

  I derive great personal use and pleasure from a complex graph of
  historical themes and trends. But, for communicative purposes,
  shared metaphor is the most succinct tool history has to
  offer. People are moved by the stories of great persons and peoples
  throughout the ages. Hardcore History is built of those stories. For
  those who say Hardcore History overdramatic: the name should have
  been a hint that it offers more than just dry facts. That
  non-tenure-track[^not_comp] component sets Hardcore History apart
  from a genre full of the alternative.

  Hardcore History does at least one other thing uniquely well. It
  tells a good metahistory, how history has been produced, recorded,
  and interpreted over the years. No other show has been able to
  strike the same qualifying balance of endorsement and caveat without
  distracting from the key narratives.

  [^not_comp]: No offense to meant to any professors; I realize there
  are many who can be as passionate. Not that it's a
  competition. Hardcore History would not be possible without the hard
  work of Historians Like Youâ„¢.

  Early episodes are shorter and more thematic than specific, so I
  recommend starting from the beginning.

review: >-

  I hate the news. Even when the reporting is decent, it's almost
  always depressing. Science news runs the opposite course. Every
  story is overflowing with progress and promise. Occasionally there's
  a retraction, but even that speaks to accountability. The Nature
  Podcast embodies all of this as a pleasant and upbeat selection on
  an arbitrary blend of science news as deemed important by the most
  important science journal of our day.

  Even so, the Nature Podcast isn't ostentatious. Like the journal,
  it's British, but the content is entirely international. The
  majority of stories are ones covered in the journal, but attention
  is always paid to non-Nature stories. Most of the stories featured
  are deliberately relatable, not just the most impactful relative to
  their field. To run down the list in priority order of Nature
  Podcast coverage:

    1. Space
    2. Cures for diseases
    3. Neurology and neurosciences
    4. Genetic research
    5. Dinosaurs and cavemen
    6. Robots
    7. Other science (biology, physics, chemistry, materials, meta)

  They're big on "extras", parallel episodes in the same feed as the
  weekly podcast. One series of extras focuses on sound (appropriate
  for the medium), another on predictions, and yet another
  interviewing the reporters on their reactions and passionsabout
  current stories. They even have a whole separate podcast for
  neurosciences. I've given them all a try and a pass. Their
  documentary and conversational formats just aren't up to the quality
  of other programs. But I will continue to listen to every episode of
  the main Nature Podcast. For a weekly optimism booster shot, it
  can't be beat!

review: >-

  Currently my highest-rated BBC program. Thinking Allowed's approach
  to current Western social issues may be as strong as the wordplay in
  its name. Undeniably British, but an easy majority of episodes are
  relevant to Western life. The host, Laurie Taylor, is full of care
  and charisma. As a rule, the guests are well-spoken and
  qualified. It follows that the conversations are predictably
  educational and engaging, especially for being unrehearsed and
  seemingly only lightly edited.

  In fact, the format is almost too engaging. Only 30 minutes long,
  they pack in two issues per episode, separated by letters from
  listeners. I appreciate that two issues cuts the chance of episode
  missing totally. But the issues are usually strong, and I lament
  when a guest is cut short, right when the issue starts getting
  interesting. If I had to venture a further critique, it would be to
  nitpick and point out that this is the only top-tier podcast where I
  consistently hear breathing. Then again, that could just be the
  fast-paced, constructive conversation.

  The most normal news-like program to which I'll subject myself. The
  equation, in a nutshell: take a popular news story and do a deeper
  dive. These stories often rely on human interest. Sometimes there's
  an episode or a series providing an reasonable overview of a topic,
  those can be ok. The episode format varies, but the production
  quality is always high. After listening for over a year, there's
  definitely a Western political slant. But this isn't Al-Jazeera
  International, it's the BBC.

  The release schedule is more surprising. Some months 20+ episodes
  come out, other times a week or two will go by with one episode. My
  experience is one to three worthwhile episodes per month, with
  titles and descriptions being pretty good indicators. BBC World
  Service signal to noise is low, but the signal is still worthwhile.

review: >-

  Billed as philosophical, but strongly campaigns for modern reference
  and relatability, leading me to classify it as closer to "Thinking
  Allowed" than a history or a philosophy podcast. The unique format
  has each episode featuring typically four guests, each assigned
  under 15 minutes to present a take or angle on a broader
  philosophical issue. There are some high highs and some low lows
  among the subtopics, hosts, and presentations, especially the
  tedious, semi-conversational introductory segments. But summing up
  all remaining segments, coverage usually ends up back in the black.

  BBC actually presents the podcast and radio differently. They slice
  up these longer episodes into the individual segments. This is a bit
  harder to navigate at first, but in the long run makes it a lot
  easier to prefilter undesirable clips like the introductions. The
  guest hosts almost always reintroduce themselves and end up
  restating everything they said in their introduction
  anyways. Overall a very fine show.
