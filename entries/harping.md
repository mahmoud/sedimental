title: Harping up the wrong tree

Harpers to the left, please. Purposes served by Listen to Wikipedia:

  * Sounds nice enough, as witnessed with the author's own
    students. Ambient and functional.
  * In my experience, writing, editing, curating, and creating are all
    lonely tasks. With Listen to Wikipedia you hear your comrades hard
    at work.
  * This is the key[^firstmistake] mistake of the author. Listen to
    Wikipedia, along with each of the rest of the Hatnote projects,
    exists as an engagement tool, helping people read and edit Wikipedia.
  * Scroll down to see the dozens of non-English languages
    supported. Most of these are wikis that may see one edit per
    minute. An editor on those sites can switch to other tasks until a
    bell or string sounds and immediately come back to review the edit
    and further participate in creating knowledge. It's an
    aesthetically mindful notification system.
  * Most people have never even thought about editing Wikipedia. Not
    who does it, not how it's done, and not how to do it. Listen To
    Wikipedia gives answers to these questions in relatable terms.
  * My mind reels at the thought of comparing the very specific
    capital-I Internet to something as potentially abstract as
    capital-N Nature.

I will not hear that those willing to volunteer their knowledge and
expertise deserve fewer tools, especially in the name of defending
aesthetics. The author has clearly not experienced the process of
editing on Wikipedia, because for the average good-faith editor, it
ranges from summarily dismissive to thanklessly ascetic to whitewater
rabidity. Something like Listen to Wikipedia is a token of
functional elegance built in appreciation of -- and for others to
appreciate -- the millions of edits and thousands of editors taken for
granted.

Nature doesn't need Coleridge's fizzly passions. On the modern
Internet, we find Wikipedia stuck between poets and profits.

Wikipedia's openness allows occasional vandalism, and the openness
complements this with allowances for administrative automation to
handle such marginal edits. But in the middle we saw countless unseen
and unheard edits, most bound to stay in the article for years. Listen
to Wikipedia is not about symbolic, ephemeral transcendence, it is
rooted in immediate, permanent presence.

[^firstmistake]: Technically, the first mistake of the author was to
  state that knowledge can be removed from Wikipedia. All edits add to
  the site. Even blanking a whole page creates metadata about the
  sentiments of the more unruly Wikipedians.
