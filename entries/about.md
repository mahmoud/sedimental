I'm Mahmoud Hashemi. I write software and words in California.

This is my personal site, where I enjoy combining software and words
into accessible-yet-thorough engineering guides. In 2016, this habit
has spilled over into [O'Reilly's Enterprise Software with
Python][esp].

When I'm not doing that, [I make a lot][gh] of
[open-source software][osp]. I'm [an avid Wikipedian][hn], too. I
really can't imagine such a thing as too much [free culture][fc]!

Professionally, I've worked as a software architect and engineer at
[PayPal][pp_blog] and [Shopkick][sk_blog]. For a number of years I've
led teams to build Python frameworks, with emphasis on robustness,
performance, and maintainability. If you're interested in my Python
background, check out [this brief
history](/python_community_intro.html "Python Community Intro").

If I have a theme song, it's SimCity 2000 music. Catch me whistling it
when I think no one's around.
