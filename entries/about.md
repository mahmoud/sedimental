I'm Mahmoud Hashemi. I write software and words in California.

This is my personal site, where I enjoy combining software and words
into accessible-yet-thorough engineering guides. This habit has
spilled over into [numerous talks](/talks.html), as well as
[O'Reilly's Enterprise Software with Python][esp].

When I'm not doing that, [I make a lot][gh] of
[open-source software][osp]. I'm [an avid Wikipedian][hn], too. I
really can't imagine such a thing as too much [free culture][fc]!

Professionally, I've worked as a software architect and engineer at
[PayPal][pp_blog], [Shopkick][sk_blog], and now
[SimpleLegal][sl_site]. For a number of years I've led teams to build
Python frameworks, with emphasis on robustness, performance, and
maintainability. These days I'm focused on building enterprise
software products with those same characteristics. If you're
interested in my Python background, check out [this brief
history](/python_community_intro.html "Python Community Intro").

If I have a theme song, it's SimCity 2000 music. Catch me whistling it
when I think no one's around.
