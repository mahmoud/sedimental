I'm Mahmoud Hashemi. I write software and words in California.

This is my personal site, where I enjoy combining software and words
into accessible-yet-thorough engineering guides. As of 2016, this
habit has spilled over to my latest project, [O'Reilly's Enterprise
Software with Python][esp].

When I'm not doing that, [I make a lot][gh] of
[open-source software][osp]. I'm [an avid Wikipedian][hn], too. I
really can't imagine such a thing as too much [free culture][fc]!

By day, I work at [PayPal][pp]. For a number of years I've led the Python
frameworks group, with a recent focus on high-performance,
high-robustness application security services. You can read
[my PayPal writings here][pp_blog]. You'll note the signature
thoroughness/length. If you're interested in my Python background,
check out [this brief history](/python_community_intro.html "Python
Community Intro").

If I have a theme song, it's SimCity 2000 music. Catch me whistling it
when I think no one's around.

You can email me at mahmoud@hatnote.com, but most people just
[follow me on Twitter][tw].
