I'm Mahmoud Hashemi. I write software and words in California.

This is my personal site, where I enjoy combining software and words
into accessible-yet-thorough engineering guides. This habit has
spilled over into [numerous talks](/talks.html),
[appearances](/appearances.html), as well as [O'Reilly's Enterprise
Software with Python][esp].

When I'm not doing that, [I make a lot][gh] of
[open-source software][osp]. I'm [an avid Wikipedian][hn], too. I
really can't imagine such a thing as too much [free culture][fc]!

Professionally, I've built software and led teams at
[PayPal][pp_site], [Shopkick][sk_site], [SimpleLegal][sl_site], and
[Stripe][stripe_site]. For a number of years I focused on Python
frameworks, with emphasis on robustness, performance, and
maintainability. These days I'm focused on building enterprise
software products with those same characteristics. If you're
interested in my Python background, check out [this brief
history](/python_community_intro.html "Python Community Intro").

If I have a theme song, it's SimCity 2000 music. Catch me whistling it
when I think no one's around.

You can email me at mahmoud@hatnote.com, but most people just
[subscribe to the feed][feed] or [follow me on Twitter][tw].

If that's still not enough, you can find some of my older posts on
[the PayPal technology blog][pp_blog], and [Python Does What?!][pdw].
