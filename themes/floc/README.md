# Chert Floc

This is the Chert **Floc** theme, created as a successor to the
original default **Sedimental** theme. **Floc** was designed for
readability, specifically with a larger, serif copy font.

The code is BSD-licensed, so definitely customize it and leave
a note [here](http://github.com/mahmoud/chert/issues) when your
modifications are publicly visible! Always love a new site theme.
