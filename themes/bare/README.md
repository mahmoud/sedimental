# Chert Bare

This is the Chert **Bare** theme, created as a minimal alternative, for
those more inspired by the [Dan Luu](https://danluu.com/) and the
like. **Bare** also doubles as a good starting point for new themes.

The code is BSD-licensed, so definitely customize it and leave
a note [here](http://github.com/mahmoud/chert/issues) when your
modifications are publicly visible! Always love a new site theme.
