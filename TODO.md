### Avoiding Import Nightmares

Even though it's safe to assume any given Python project will include
many, many files, how you take that first step from one file to
multiple is a critical. Python's reputation for "one obvious way" to
do things starts to break down with imports and by the time we reach
packaging, not even the number of ways is obvious.

This isn't all Python's fault. Python's adaptability is

* Flask as an example of an architecture that invites/encourages circular imports
* Use absolute imports
    * setup.py develop
* Python is a powerful language. The basic in-built language
  constructs are all it takes for composing large applications.
